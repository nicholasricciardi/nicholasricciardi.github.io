        <p>This week’s lecture was provided by Aditya Kapoor from Intel Security / McAfee Labs.  The topic of his lecture was rootkits which are “malware that actively conceals its existance and actions from users and systems processes”.   This differs from a bootkit which does not conceal its identity.  A bootkit functions by modifying the master boot record (MBR) to gain control of a user’s machine.  I was surprised to learn that there are much fewer rootkits for 64 bit Windows and they are much more common in 32 bit Windows.  Overall, 10% of malware uses rootkits so it is a very common threat.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally, rootkits operate on the kernel.  Many rootkits are hidden in the .sys files which are part of the Kernel-Mode drivers.  Once the kernel is infiltrated, there are a number of weaknesses.  First, kernel memory is flat and has no security separation.  Second, kernel drivers can access any part of memory.  Lastly, the kernel memory can be manipulated to maintain stealth for the rootkit, through structures such as the SSDT, IRP, IDT, etc.  The SSDT is the system service description table. </p>

        <p>The first lab went through the Agony rootkit analysis.  Unfortunately, I was one of the few students who struggled with the directions.  Instead of renaming the file bad, we were putting the file in a folder called bad.  This was because we were renaming the file during the unzipping prompt, instead of unzipping and then renaming.  This was not discovered until Tuesday on Piazza, so there was less time to work through the lab.  I have included my answer for the memory location of the function calls in the comments section of this homework assignment.</p>
