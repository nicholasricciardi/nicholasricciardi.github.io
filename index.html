        <p>This week’s lecture was provided by Aditya Kapoor from Intel Security / McAfee Labs.  The topic of his lecture was rootkits which are “malware that actively conceals its existance and actions from users and systems processes”.   This differs from a bootkit which does not conceal its identity.  A bootkit functions by modifying the master boot record (MBR) to gain control of a user’s machine.  I was surprised to learn that there are much fewer rootkits for 64 bit Windows and they are much more common in 32 bit Windows.  Overall, 10% of malware uses rootkits so it is a very common threat.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally, rootkits operate on the kernel.  Many rootkits are hidden in the .sys files which are part of the Kernel-Mode drivers.  Once the kernel is infiltrated, there are a number of weaknesses.  First, kernel memory is flat and has no security separation.  Second, kernel drivers can access any part of memory.  Lastly, the kernel memory can be manipulated to maintain stealth for the rootkit, through structures such as the SSDT, IRP, IDT, etc.  The SSDT is the system service description table. </p>

        <p>The first lab went through the Agony rootkit analysis.  Unfortunately, I was one of the few students who struggled with the directions.  Instead of renaming the file bad, we were putting the file in a folder called bad.  This was because we were renaming the file during the unzipping prompt, instead of unzipping and then renaming.  This was not discovered until Tuesday on Piazza, so there was less time to work through the lab.  I have included my answer for the memory location of the function calls in the comments section of this homework assignment.  The lab used Tuluka which can look at memory addresses of various portions of the kernel and highlight which point outside the kernel boundaries.  This helps identify potential malware.  The lab also used Cuckoo wand performed some live kernel debugging.  In the live kernel debugging demo, we could use various API calls such as NtQueryDirectoryFile to show how malware can using stealth.</p>

        <p>Aditya also went over some basics of OS theory.  Threads are the smallest unit of operation in an OS.  High level languages are compiled into assembly code which is translated to machine code which we see as hex values in the various tools we use.  In a small example, we saw how the machine code 03 c3 means adding.  Thismachine code is loaded into RAM which is transferred to the CPU using the BUS.  The CPU fetches the additional instructions and exectures.  The thread scheduler is what handles all the threads in queue by assigning thread priorities.  Application programmers can specify the priority of threads when they are developing software.  Additionally, the thread scheduler will boost priority of threads that have been waiting for a while.</p>

        <p>Hyperthreading began as using two instruction pipelines.  The pipelines split up various functionalities of the CPU, so the math enginer may have been located in one thread.  This didn't go well due to conflicts when the same components were required.  Then, the concept of cores emerged.  Within a single CPU package, cores duplicated the functionality of all subcomponents which allows much faster processing.  Granted, this still requires the writing of multi threaded applications to get the full advantages.</p>

        <p>Threads can be examined using Windbg.  Each thread has it's own stack.  Executable objects can contain one or more threads.  There is some confusion about the differences between processes and threads.  Processes are implemented as objects.  Processes are written when we write programs, not threads.  Threads are spawned within the process boundary.</p>

        <p>The second lab used process hacker which is a tool written by researchers.  It is similar to process explorer but it shows more details.  The tool can walk through virutal memory of a process and identify attributes of memory such as committed memory, free memory, and their respective addresses.  Importantly, it shows the protection: readable, writeable, executable, etc.  All processes within Windows OS have up to 4 GB of memory allocated to thim but this is typically mcuh more than is needed.  For each process you will see an image area which is where you want to focus your analysis, as this is where most of the important stuff happens.</p>

        <p>Rootkits modify bytes in memory and are able to put code in other executables.  Many times these will show up in process hacker as Private processes and they will have considerable access rights which is suspicious.  Whereas the first lab focused on kernel mode exploits, this lab focuses on user mode exploits.  The general structure is for the malware to inject into processes and modiy process code.  One of the ways this is performed is by modifying the first few bytes with a jump to address.  So, instead of executing the function prologue, it jumps to an offset with with bad code.  When the bad code is finished, it will restore the program to normal flow.  One form of protection for this is checking where pointers point to and seeing if those are trusted areas.  A scanning service can use pattern matching that periodically runs and checks if pointers go out of bounds.  Of course this is a reactive methodology that only works once the malware is on the device.</p>

        <p>In 2013, a cyber attack was performed on South Korea to try to wipe a number of computer systems.  The attack was structured to modify the master boot record so that machines would effectivelly be bricked upon boot.  This was called Viper and it has even been seen recently which is interesting.  You would think that such a high profile attack would be well protected against in the future, but it must have been modified in a way that still makes it useful.</p>
